    <h2>What is DAIBETES about?</h2>
    <p>DAIBETES is an experimental project designed to assist people with type 1 diabetes in managing their condition and
        maintaining blood sugar levels. The final aim of the project is to be able to accurately predict insulin dosage based 
        on various user information, such as their alimentation (Openfood Fact API-based), their blood sugar levels (based on FreeStyle Libre data),
        how they feel.</p>

    <h2>Why am I developing this application?</h2>
    <p>I have often been called a 'bad' type 1 diabetic, and I struggle to count everything I eat. I am also passionate about AI in healthcare and its multiple facets.
