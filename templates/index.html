    <h2>What is DAIBETES about?</h2>
    <p>My AI application is designed to assist people with type 1 diabetes in managing their condition and
        maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. Using the Openfood Fact API, users can input information about
        their meals, how they feel, and any other factors that may impact their sugar levels. They can also
        input data from their Freestyle Libre device. Based on this information and the user's historical data,
        our AI system is able to predict how much insulin the user should inject. We hope that this tool will
        make it easier for people with type 1 diabetes to take control of their health and feel confident in
        their insulin dosage decisions.</p>

    <h2>Why am I developing this application?</h2>
    <p>As someone who lives with type 1 diabetes, I know firsthand how challenging it can be to manage my
        condition and keep my blood sugar levels in check. That's why I'm so excited about the AI application I
        am developing. I hope it can help others with type 1 diabetes as well.</p>
